Compare countries of the world to each other in an interactive bar chart.

This project is about allowing the user to make a selection of 8 countries from a list of over 200 and then to visually compare these countries to each other. The countries can be compared from different aspects. For example, by population or by area per square mile or by GDP per capita, etc.

On the top of the web page there is a row of 8 drop-down list-boxes. Each list-box contains the same list of over 200 countries. The user can select one country from each of the 8 drop-down list-boxes. Each list-box has a different colour. The colour scheme corresponds to the colour scheme of the bars on the bar chart.

On the line below the list boxes there are 6 radio buttons with descriptive names for each button. Only one of the 6 radio buttons can be selected at a time. The radio button selected determines the type of bar chart you want to see. For example, if you select the GDP radio button then you want to see 8 countries you selected compared to each other by GDP per capita. The title of the bar chart changes depending on the radio button selected, to help the user to understand the meaning of the bar chart.

There is also a sort button. When you click it then the countries will be sorted into descending order and rearranged on the bar chart and in the order in which they appear in the 8 list boxes.
